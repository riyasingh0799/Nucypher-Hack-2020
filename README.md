 ### NuCypher Location Proofs 

In the current scenario of a worldwide pandemic, it is crucial for the infection to be contained by self-quarantine, especially when a person has come in contact with another person prior to or after their being tested positive for Covid-19. 

I have created this app to help the trusted govt institutions verify that a suspected Covid-19 carrying person is staying at their primary location (home, or some hospital, testing facility, etc). 
The app will allow the user to share his/her present location securely with the trusted institution, without it falling into the wrong hands. Thus, the personal data and the primary location of a quarantined person will remain private.
At the time of registry, a unique ID and the GPS coordinates of their primary location are stored for a person. The trusted govt institution/official can then check if the person is within 10 m of the primary location till the end of the quarantine period.
